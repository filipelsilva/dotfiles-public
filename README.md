# Filipe Ligeiro Silva's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. You could use them to inspire yourself, and make your own!

The commits are more sporadic on the public version, as I started the private
version way earlier, and might still be trying out new things over there.

There are two sections:

## 1. Dotfiles (*per se*)

These consist of configurations for the following:

* Alacritty
* (Neo)Vim
* Tmux
* Zsh
* i3
* Git

## 2. Installers

Scripts made by me, in order to link the dotfiles to their places and install
all needed packages.
Keep in mind: these are **very likely to break**, therefore **use them at your
own risk**.

Usage:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipelsilva/dotfiles-public $HOME/dotfiles
cd $HOME/dotfiles
./run.sh
```
